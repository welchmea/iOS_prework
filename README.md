## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The only challenge that occurred while trying to build the app was connecting the UI to Logic. I initially did not see that IBAction was not the default option, so it caused syntax errors.   

## App Brainstorming

App 1: Kindle
 -- Stores and returns to previous location in the book that is being read. 
 -- Allows for linking of ebooks from public library

 App 2: Spotify
 -- Allows for custom listening options, such as single artist, single album, and finishing playlists
 -- Has podcasts in addition to audiobooks and music

 App 3: Youtube
 -- Variety of content from music to commentary to political news
 -- highlights most viewed portions of videos, and captions segments for quick viewing options

The app that I would like to build is a local scheduler/review app that is catered to professionals in the beauty industry. The app would allow self-employed individuals to advertise their services for a small fee. They could schedule clients and leave reviews for their customers as well as list current promotions and post pictures. It would also allow prospective clients to review their services and cancel/reschedule appointments. There would be filtering options based upon locale, price, review, and availability.
